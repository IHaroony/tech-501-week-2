## SSH Into Instances and Load Balancer

### 1. **Overview**

This document provides the necessary steps to SSH into your load balancer instance and other instances running.
### 2. **Prerequisites**

- Ensure your private key (e.g., `tech501-haroon-az-key`) is available and has the correct permissions.
- You should know the IP addresses or DNS names of your load balancer and target instances.
- Ensure that the security groups or firewall rules are configured to allow SSH traffic (port 22).

### 3. **SSH Into Load Balancer**

Your load balancer should be running on a public IP address or be accessible through a bastion host.

- **Command to SSH into Load Balancer**:
    
    
    `ssh -i /path/to/tech501-haroon-az-key azureuser@<load-balancer-public-ip>`
    
    Replace `<load-balancer-public-ip>` with the actual public IP of the load balancer.
    
- **Important**:
    
    - If the load balancer uses specific ports like 5000, make sure the security group allows access to this port.
    - Load balancers typically don’t serve as SSH access points, but ensure you have a connection method, such as SSH tunneling or connecting to backend instances.

### 4. **SSH Into Frontend Instances**

Your frontend instances may be running on specific ports like 5000, 5001, or 5002. To SSH into these, follow the steps below.

#### 4.1 **SSH into Frontend Instance on Port 5000**:

- If the instance is directly accessible via SSH, use the following command:
    

    `ssh -i /path/to/tech501-haroon-az-key azureuser@<frontend-instance-ip>`
    
    Replace `<frontend-instance-ip>` with the actual IP of the frontend instance.
    

### 5. **SSH Command Breakdown (Example)*

Here’s a detailed explanation of a typical SSH command to connect to instances:

#### Example Command:



`ssh -i ~/.ssh/tech501-haroon-az-key -p 50000 adminuser@172.187.118.34`

#### Explanation:

- **`ssh`**: Initiates the SSH protocol.
- **`-i ~/.ssh/tech501-haroon-az-key`**: Specifies the private key used for authentication. The private key is stored at `~/.ssh/tech501-haroon-az-key`.
- **`-p 50000`**: Indicates the custom port number `50000` for SSH access (default is 22). This means the SSH server on the remote instance is listening on port `50000` instead of the default port `22`.
- **`adminuser@172.187.118.34`**: The username (`adminuser`) and the IP address of the remote server (`172.187.118.34`). The server can be accessed using this username at this IP address.
